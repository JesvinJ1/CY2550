**Project 0: Bicycle World (Linux Introduction)**
In this project, I was introduced to basic Linux commands and file system navigation. The task involved working with the Unix command line to navigate, extract, and modify files within a “bicycle-world” directory.

**Project 1: File Manipulation and Permissions**
This project provided hands-on experience using a command shell in a Linux environment, simulating real-world scenarios where access to a remote server is gained through SSH. The task involved completing a series of levels by discovering hidden flags within various directories. Each level introduced different Linux commands and challenges, ranging from file manipulation, searching hidden files, working with hashes, and more.

**Project 2: Encrypt, Sign, Decrypt**
In this project, I implemented key pair generation, encryption, and digital signing using the PGP standard with GnuPG GPG. The goal was to understand and apply principles of encryption and secure communication using public and private keys. As a whole, this project taught how to generate a key pair for myself, learn the basics of generating, signing, and managing PGP keys, and encrypting and signing messages.

**Project 4: Password Cracking**
In this project, I gained hands-on experience cracking passwords by working with a leaked shadow file from a Linux system. The file contained 50 hashed passwords with a sliding difficulty scale, and the task was to decrypt each one using password cracking tools like John the Ripper (JTR) and Hashcat. This project required employing a variety of attacks, including wordlist-based, hybrid attacks, mask attacks, and brute force to crack passwords. By utilizing Hashcat, I was able to fully utilize my GPU with OpenCL to crack multiple hashes in parallel all while fine-tuning the attack using custom masks and hybrid strategies.
